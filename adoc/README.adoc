[.text-center]
My name is Rabenherz, also known by some as Lp_Zombie. +
I'm an IT specialist working at Serviceware SE, where I handle the security of the IT systems to ensure smooth operations.
[.text-center]
Apart from my work, I am passionate about self-hosting, which is why I have set up multiple V-Servers, Raspberry PIs, and Synology NAS to offer various web services and Discord bots. I love tinkering with new technology and experimenting with different coding languages. JavaScript and PowerShell are my favorites, and I always challenge myself with different programming projects to improve my skills. +
Another hobby of mine is reading manga, and I have an extensive manga collection that I am proud of. I enjoy hosting and sharing my collection with others who have a similar interest. In my free time, I like to unwind by playing Rouge-Likes or catching up on the latest anime.
[.text-center]
Overall, I am a driven individual who enjoys technology and the creative possibilities it offers. I always strive to learn new things and apply them to both my personal and professional life.

Open-source software is something I am passionate about. While I may not be a heavy maintainer or contributor, and scripting are not my strong suit, I do what I can to contribute to the community. Whether it's fixing minor issues that might have been overlooked, making general improvements, helping with reviewing Pull Requests or enhancing documentation. I believe that every little bit helps when it comes to open-source projects.

a|==== Debian +
Debian is a free and open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel. It is one of the most popular Linux distributions and is known for its stability, security, and community-driven development.

I use Debian for the most of my personal Infrastructure, since it's secure, doesn't need alot of ressources and is easy to manage. ^.^|image:assets/debian-logo.svg["Commits",120,120]

I use Windows on various personal and work devices and is my preferred operating system for productivity tasks and gaming.
